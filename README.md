A react native starter kit app template with various useful screens ready to go (Home, Dashboard, Login...).

The goal is to get you writing your next react-native app in minutes and save you hours (and thousands of dollars) 
reinventing the wheel for common modules such as a Login or Settings page. 

## What galium is 
* A great place to start a full react native app project
* A collection of prebuilt screen with exquisite designs to pick and choose for your next project

## What galium is NOT
* A full stack framework. 
* A ready to ship app. You need to add your custom business logic

## Screens
At present 11 screens are supported:
* Home 
* Dashboard
* Profile (and Profilev2)
* Login
* Register
* Articles
* Article 
* Article cover
* Onboarding
* Presentation
* Grid
* Settings

## Credits
galium is built on and heavily uses [galio](https://github.com/galio-org/galio) and [galio-starter-kit](https://github.com/galio-org/galio-starter-kit).
